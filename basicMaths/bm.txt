extraction of digits 

N = 7743%10 = 3
/10
N = 774%10 = 4
/10
N = 77%10 = 7
/10
N = 7%10 = 7
/10
N = 0%10 = 0

while(N> 0){
    lastdigit = N%10;
    N = N/10;
}

Time Complexities = 0(log10(N))
Note: When division process happens always remember logarithmic time complexity comes into picture

armstrong number => cube of each digit and sum of them should be equal to the number itself

print all divisors => underoot of n , loop till square root of n and print it
