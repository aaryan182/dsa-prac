Hashing

arr[10^9+1] we cannot declare 

max we can arr[10^6] inside main
arr[10^9] we can do globally arr 

character hashing 
corresponding value = given character - 'a' is 97 

f -a = 102 - 97 = 5

ordered map and unordered map 

map < key  , value > mp;
map stores all the values in sorted order 

map<char,int> mp;

time complexity of map storing and fetching => O(log(n)) for average, best and worst case

unordered map => order is not defined 
storing and fetching => O(1) average and best , worst case => O(n)

always use unordered map first then go to map
